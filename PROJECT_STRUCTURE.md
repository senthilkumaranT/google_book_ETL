## Directory Descriptions

### `dags/`
Contains all Airflow DAG definitions. The main DAG file `dag.py` implements the Google Books ETL pipeline.

### `config/`
Airflow configuration files. The `airflow.cfg` file contains Airflow settings.

### `plugins/`
Directory for custom Airflow plugins (operators, hooks, sensors, executors). Currently empty but ready for future extensions.

### `logs/`
Airflow execution logs are stored here. This directory is automatically created and populated by Airflow. It's excluded from git via `.gitignore`.

## Important Files

### `docker-compose.yaml`
Docker Compose configuration that sets up:
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis message broker
- Airflow services (scheduler, worker, webserver, etc.)
- pgAdmin for database management

### `requirements.txt`
Python package dependencies. Note: Most packages are included in the Airflow Docker image, but this file serves as documentation.

### `.gitignore`
Specifies files and directories to exclude from version control:
- Python cache files (`__pycache__/`)
- Log files
- Environment files (`.env`)
- IDE configuration files

### `.env.example`
Template for environment variables. Copy this to `.env` and customize as needed.

### `README.md`
Complete project documentation including setup instructions, usage, and troubleshooting.
